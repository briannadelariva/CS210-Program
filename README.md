# CS210-Program


- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project is the Grocer Frequency App that was a class project for my CS-210 Programming Languages (C++) course. This app is designed to solve a grocery stores problem of calculating the exact amount of produce items sold in one day. It would provide a word list frequency, a word with frequency next to it, and then a third option was to view the frequency for each item as a histogram list using asterisks. 

- What did you do particularly well?

Something I did particularly well was with the histogram frequency option. This was a challenging piece to put together and ensure the histogram was visually pleasing yet accurate according to the screen. 

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I believe some longer term ideas I would have for enhancing the code and its capabilities would be in the list options. For example, rather than displaying all of the produce items sold into the results and their frequencies, it could have an added feature to only check the frequency of select words. This could help enhance the code and more it more efficent for the user in calculating their data. 

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I feel the piece of code I found most difficult to write revolved around the histogram feature. This was a challenging bit to figure out due to the wide ranging number of freqency results there would be for each item. I had to adjust the range and conversion of the asteriks for the results as a histogram to be reflected in a more logical manner. Additionally, to allow the the data to all start at the same point even though each produce name had different lengths. I think there was a lot of little key aspects that had to be kept in mind during the coding for it. I overcame this by utilizing the internet as my research tool and finding information through 

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
Some skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects or coursework is in problem solving and practicing algorithmic thinking. All programming languages involve problem solving and algorithmic thinking when working with various syntaxes and this skill can be easily transferable to future new languages I learn. 

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
This program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by fulfilling all functionality needs. It was enhanced with frequent comments throughout the code to help with the readability to future developers, it was maintained by meticulous debugging measures being performed, and it was adaptable by having multiple feautures.
